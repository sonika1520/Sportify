## Project Name
**Sportify**
## Project Description
Finding individuals or groups with similar sports interests and organizing events can be challenging, especially for those new to a city or seeking partners with specific skill levels. Traditional methods of connecting, such as word of mouth or social media, are often inefficient and lack tailored options for event management. This gap leads to missed opportunities for engagement, limited access to recreational or competitive activities, and reduced motivation to stay active. The lack of a centralized platform that combines event creation, user matching, and seamless communication highlights the need for a solution to bring sports enthusiasts together efficiently and effectively.

Sportify is a web-based platform designed to connect individuals with similar sports interests, making it easier for people to engage in recreational or competitive activities. Users can create and join sports events in their area, customize event details like location, time and interact with others through integrated chat features. The platform includes user profiles for event browsing and location-based filtering to find nearby events. By fostering an active community, the platform encourages social connections and healthy lifestyles while providing an intuitive interface for seamless event management and communication among sports enthusiasts.

# Backend Development Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is focused on building the backend for Sportify, a platform to connect individuals through sports events and activities. We are using **Go** for backend development and **PostgreSQL** as the database. The backend will manage various features such as user profiles, event management, and communication between users.

## Folder Structure

```
backend/
    bin/                # Contains files required by air for live reloading
    cmd/
        api/                # All API implementation code
        migrate/            # Database migrations

    internal/
        db/                 # Database connection and configurations
        env/                # Environment configuration management
        store/              # CRUD and other DB operations

    Makefile               # Handles migration and other commands
    .envrc                 # Environment variable loader for direnv
```

### Folder Descriptions

1. **bin/**: This folder contains files necessary for **air** to perform its live reloading functionality.

2. **cmd/**: This folder contains the core application code. Subfolders include:
   - `api/`: Implements the API endpoints.
   - `migrate/`: Contains database migration scripts.

3. **internal/**: Houses internal application logic that is isolated from the external API. Subfolders include:
   - `db/`: Manages the database connection and related tasks.
   - `env/`: Manages loading and handling environment variables.
   - `store/`: Implements CRUD operations and other database queries.

## Tools and Packages

Here are the primary tools and packages we use to streamline development and maintain code quality:

1. **go-chi**  
   - **Description:** Lightweight and idiomatic HTTP router for Go.
   - **Purpose:** Used for routing and middleware management.
   - **URL:** [go-chi/chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)

2. **air**  
   - **Description:** Live server reloading tool.
   - **Purpose:** Automatically reloads the server when changes are detected.
   - **URL:** [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)

3. **go-validator**  
   - **Description:** A powerful request validation package for Go.
   - **Purpose:** Used to validate incoming request fields.
   - **URL:** [go-playground/validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator)

4. **direnv**  
   - **Description:** Environment variable manager that loads variables from `.envrc` files.
   - **Purpose:** Simplifies the loading and handling of environment variables.
   - **URL:** [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

5. **TablePlus**  
   - **Description:** Database management tool.
   - **Purpose:** Allows easy creation of tables and insertion of dummy data for development.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Required Tools
Ensure the following are installed on your machine:
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)

### 2. Set Up `.envrc` File
Create an `.envrc` file in the root directory with the necessary environment variables. Example:
```env
POSTGRES_USER=your_db_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name
APP_PORT=8080
```
Run `direnv allow` to load the environment variables automatically.

### 3. Start Docker Container
Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL container:
```sh
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Install Go Dependencies
Use the following command to install project dependencies:
```sh
go mod tidy
```

### 5. Install Postgres 14
Install postgres and setup the database by running the migrations listed in the backend folder

### 6. Run the Application
For live reloading, use the **air** tool:
```sh
air
```
If you don't have air installed, use:
```sh
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

### 7. Run the frontend
For the frontend first do
```sh
npm install
```

then

```sh
npm start
```

## Makefile Commands

The `Makefile` provides common commands to simplify development tasks.

- **Create Migrations:**
  ```sh
  make migration some_file_name
  ```

- **Run Migrations:**
  ```sh
  make migrate-up
  ```

- **Rollback Migrations:**
  ```sh
  make migrate-down
  ```

Feel free to add more commands as needed.

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository and set up your environment using the steps outlined above.
2. Use **air** for live reloading or **go run** for manual server restarts.
3. Implement features in the appropriate folders under `internal/` and `cmd/`.
4. Validate API requests using **go-validator**.
5. Connect to the database using **TablePlus** to inspect and manage data.
6. Use **Makefile** commands to handle database migrations.
